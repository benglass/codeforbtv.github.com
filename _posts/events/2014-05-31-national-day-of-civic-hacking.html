    <h1>Improve Your Neighborhood and Community through Technology</h1>
    <p class="lead">Join thousands of participants from around the world for National Day of Civic Hacking at Generator. Organized by Code for BTV, the Burlington event will bring together software developers, technology integrators, designers, makers and civic hackers to improve our neighborhoods and communities through technology.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Food Systems &amp; Agriculture</li>
        <li>Renewable &amp; Sustainable Energy</li>
        <li>Arts &amp; Culture</li>
        <li>Human-powered Recreation</li>
    </ul>
