    <h1>How Can Open Data Improve Our Community?</h1>
    <p class="lead">{{ page.description }}</p>
    <p>Open data is data that is openly available for use by third parties, often provided by a government department or agency. Open data can lead to greater transparency, more accountability, citizen participation, innovation, and improved effectiveness and efficiency.</p>
    <p>The City of Burlington Mayor's Office recently started work on an open data portal. The State of Vermont is also working on its own open data portal. The inaugural Vermont Open Data Summit was hosted by the Vermont Center for Geographic Information (VCGI) this past October, beginning a statewide discussion about open data. CodeAcross BTV is an opportunity to build on this momentum and demonstrate the value of open data in Burlington and Vermont.</p>
    <p>Those who might be interested in participating include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Community members with a passion for improving their communities</li>
        <li>Community organizers</li>
        <li>Non-profits and mission-driven organizations</li>
        <li>Journalists and bloggers</li>
        <li>Urbanists</li>
        <li>Civic hackers, developers, designers and makers</li>
        <li>Open data advocates</li>
        <li>Government officials and staff</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Saturday Workshop</h2>
    <p>Code for BTV will facilitate a workshop at the beginning of CodeAcross BTV. This workshop will give participants an opportunity to uncover issues and opportunities that can be addressed using open data. <strong>Participants with a diversity of perspectives—from coders to open data advocates—are strongly encouraged to attend this workshop.</strong></p>
