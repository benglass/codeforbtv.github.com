    <h1>How Can Open Data Improve Our Community?</h1>
    <p class="lead">{{ page.description }}</p>
    <p>Open data is data that is openly available for use by third parties, often provided by a government department or agency. Open data can lead to greater transparency, more accountability, citizen participation, innovation, and improved effectiveness and efficiency.</p>
    <p>The City of Burlington Mayor's Office recently started work on an open data portal. The State of Vermont is also working on its own open data portal. The inaugural Vermont Open Data Summit was hosted by the Vermont Center for Geographic Information (VCGI) this past October, beginning a statewide discussion about open data. CodeAcross BTV is an opportunity to build on this momentum and demonstrate the value of open data in Burlington and Vermont.</p>
    <p>Those who might be interested in participating include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Community members with a passion for improving their communities</li>
        <li>Community organizers</li>
        <li>Non-profits and mission-driven organizations</li>
        <li>Journalists and bloggers</li>
        <li>Urbanists</li>
        <li>Civic hackers, developers, designers and makers</li>
        <li>Open data advocates</li>
        <li>Government officials and staff</li>
    </ul>
    <p>CodeAcross BTV will begin with short summaries of potential open data projects. Attendees will then actively participate in projects of interest to them.</p>
    <p class="text-muted">CodeAcross BTV is organized by Code for BTV, a Code for America Brigade.</p>
