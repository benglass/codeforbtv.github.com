        <p class="contributors"><strong>Contributors:</strong> Justin Adams, Scott MacEwan, Danielle Steimke, Collin Dewitt, Evan Yandell, Ethan Eldridge, Joshua Dickerson, Paul Kiripolsky</p>
        <p class="results">During Green Up Vermont, many inefficiencies were identified: people covering the same ground multiples times, people not knowing where high need was, and not knowing where to drop off their garbage. The group created a web-based mobile user interface with server side service to collect data points as well as forums for discussion. A client-side data system allows for the organization of data points.</p>

        <p class="contributors"><strong>Contributors:</strong> Micah Mutrux, Carl Irving, Nicholas Szumowski</p>
        <p class="results">The team created a central location where people may crowdsource information about Burlington. The wiki uses the MediaWiki platform and includes categories and a sampling of content. Importing and supporting extensions are in place (e.g., anti spam, social networking).

This information could be used by the public, by students and by the city to assess progress along the city's energy reduction goals. Our idea would be to present the energy usage data of all area schools in a way that can be searched, accessed by API and visualized.</p>

Several websites for nonprofits have already been created via Code for BTV volunteers, and there are additional websites that are needed. The websites thus far have been built using WordPress.</p>
