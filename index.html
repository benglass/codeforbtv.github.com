                <h1>Projects</h1>
                <p>More than 20 Code for BTV projects have been started since the National Day of Civic Hacking in June of 2013.</p>
                <p>A collection of applications are under development that will help <strong><a href="http://bigheavyworld.com/">Big Heavy World</a></strong> promote and preserve Vermont-made music. Big Heavy World is a non-profit organization and a defacto music office for both the State of Vermont and the City of Burlington. Big Heavy World projects include a <strong>live music venue directory</strong>, a <strong>discussion forum</strong> for Vermont musicians, a <strong>music events calendar</strong>, and a <strong>Vermont artist directory</strong>.</p>
                <p>Code for BTV volunteers developed a <strong>"green" printing app</strong> for <strong><a href="http://www.fletcherfree.org/">Fletcher Free Library</a></strong>. This app is designed to reduce unintentional and wasteful printing in the library's public access computer center by telling users how many pages they are about to print and the cost of this printing.</p>
                <p>Collaborating with the <strong><a href="http://vtrural.org/programs/digital-economy">Vermont Digital Economy Project</a></strong>, volunteers working with Code for BTV have built or improved <strong>websites for over a dozen non-profit organizations</strong> and plan to work on many more of these websites. The Vermont Digital Economy Project has found that <strong>communities with digitally connected non-profit organizations are more resilient to natural disasters</strong>, so these websites are helping to make Vermont communities more resilient.</p>
                <p><strong><a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/lakecraft/">Lakecraft</a></strong> is an educational tool that engages youth and adults in science by gamifying the Lake Champlain Basin using open GIS data and a custom modification to Minecraft.</p>

                <h1>Open Data Initiative</h1>
                <p>The City of Burlington Mayor's Office recently started work on an <strong>open data portal</strong>, and Code for BTV is working with them on this initiative.</p>
            </article>
            <article>
                <h1>Civic Cloud Collaborative</h1>
                <p>The Civic Cloud Collaborative is exploring what it means to provide <strong>public, educational, and government access for producers of Internet applications and digital creative works</strong>. The Civic Cloud Collaborative is close to being able to install a full rack of servers within the core of Burlington's municipally-owned gigabit fiber-optic network. These servers will be used to host <strong>non-commercial Internet applications that have community benefit</strong>.</p>
                <p>The Civic Cloud Collaborative is comprised of Big Heavy World, CCTV Center for Media &amp; Democracy, Code for BTV, Found Line, Laboratory B, Regional Educational Technology Network (RETN), and Vermont Community Access Media (VCAM). Found Line has facilitated the development of the Civic Cloud Collaborative.</p>

                <h1>New Moran</h1>
                <p>New Moran is a plan to redevelop the landmark Moran Generating Station on Burlington's waterfront into a mixed-use, energy self-sufficient civic space. New Moran will be a hub for community gatherings while supporting human-powered recreation and access to local food, art, energy, and technology. Code for BTV is a New Moran program partner and plans to use New Moran as a <strong>community research &amp; development hub</strong>, an <strong>educational space</strong>, and a <strong>space for gathering and collaboration</strong>.</p>
