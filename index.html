    <p>The following projects are a few of those currently under active development.</p>
    <article id="project-green-printing-app">
        <h1 class="title">"Green" Printing App</h1>
        <p class="org">Fletcher Free Library</p>
        <p class="results">Fletcher Free Library identified an oportunity to reduce unintentionally wasteful printing in their public access Computer Center. As a result of the work of civic hackers, they now have an application on the computers in their Computer Center that tell the user how many pages they are about to print and the cost.</p>

        <h1 class="title">Library Statistics App</h1>
        <p class="org">Fletcher Free Library</p>
        <p class="results">Statistics for libraries are like revenue numbers for businesses—they are very important. Fletcher Free Library keeps statistics on many things like checkouts, door counts, website visits, computer center logins, Wi-Fi logins, volunteer hours, etc. A team is now working on a web-based app that employees will be able to use to submit their numbers.</p>

        <p class="results">An educational tool that engages youth and adults in science by gamifying the Lake Champlain Basin. Using a custom modification to Minecraft, the group's goal is to eventually have a tool that may be used at the ECHO Center, at home, by educational institutions, and serve as a model to educators.</p>

    <article id="project-green-up-vermont">
        <h1 class="title">Green Up Vermont</h1>
        <p class="results">During Green Up Vermont, many inefficiencies were identified: people covering the same ground multiples times, people not knowing where high need was, and not knowing where to drop off their garbage. The group created a web-based mobile user interface with server side service to collect data points as well as forums for discussion. A client-side data system allows for the organization of data points.</p>

        <h1 class="title">Burlington City Wiki</h1>
        <p class="org">City of Burlington</p>
        <p class="results">The team created a central location where people may crowdsource information about Burlington. The wiki uses the MediaWiki platform and includes categories and a sampling of content. Importing and supporting extensions are in place (e.g., anti spam, social networking). The next step is to strategize a plan for content development and promotion of the wiki.</p>

        <h1 class="title">School Juice</h1>
        <p class="org">Burlington Electric Department</p>
        <p class="results">The team brainstormed ways to begin providing electricity usage data from Burlington's new smart meters in some useful and open ways to the public. This information could be used by the public, by students and by the city to assess progress along the city's energy reduction goals. Our idea would be to present the energy usage data of all area schools in a way that can be searched, accessed by API and visualized.</p>
